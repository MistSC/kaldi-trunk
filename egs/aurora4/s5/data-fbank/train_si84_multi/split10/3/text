01lc02011 THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
01lc02021 SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
01lc02031 MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
01lc02041 STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
01lc02051 NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
01lc02061 A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
01lc02071 A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
01lc02081 HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
01lc02091 INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
01lc020a1 ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
01lc020b1 HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
01lc020c1 THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
01lc020d1 THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
01lc020e1 THE BLACKSTONE FUND BLACKSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS L. P. IS SEEKING TO RAISE ONE BILLION DOLLARS
01lc020f1 IT HAS ALREADY GATHERED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FUND OFFICIALS SAID

01lc020h1 IN JULY AND AUGUST U. S. G. OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES THAT RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MOSTLY SALARIED POSITIONS
01lc020i1 THE INCENTIVES RESULTED IN A NINE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX CHARGE AGAINST THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
01lc020j1 THE POSITIONS ELIMINATED THROUGH EARLY RETIREMENT ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE OVERHEAD IN FUTURE YEARS BY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID
01lc020k1 NORTHGATE DECLINED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF AN EXPECTED GAIN ON THE SALE
01lc020l1 THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
01lc020m1 NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
01lc020n1 NEITHER MR. CULLINANE NOR MR. CHAPMAN WHO ALSO IS FIFTY THREE COULD BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
01lc020o1 WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED CULLINET DISCLOSED THE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS
01lc020p1 IT SAID IT PLANNED A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY
01lc020q1 S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
01lc020r1 IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
01lc020s1 THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
01lc020t1 WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
01lc020u1 THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
01lc020v1 SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
01lc020w1 BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
01lc020x1 MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
01lc020y1 SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
01lc020z1 HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
01lc02101 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
01lc02111 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE BY MESSRS.
01lc02121 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
01lc02131 THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME IN R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS IN SEPTEMBER WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND CONTRACTS MR. MOULDS SAID
01lc02141 LAST TUESDAY MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND OPTIONS TRADED ON WEDNESDAY THE DAY PRECEDING THE ANNOUNCEMENT SEVEN THOUSAND FIFTY CONTRACTS TRADED
01lc02151 AFTER THE BUY OUT PROPOSAL WAS MADE PUBLIC THURSDAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS TRADED ON THE C. B. O. E.
01lc02161 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
01lc02171 HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
01lc02181 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
01lc02191 THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
01lc021a1 BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
01lc021b1 THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
01lc021c1 BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED
01lc021d1 TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
01lc021e1 SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
01lc021f1 A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION

01mc02011 WHILE HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR WILL MOVE LOWER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES THE SOFTENING EXPORT MARKET IS PRESSURING JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN EXPORTERS
01mc02031 THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
01mc02041 THAT WOULD MAKE THE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
01mc02061 IT LARGELY REFLECTS BIG AGGRESSIVE EXPORTERS THAT HAVE RESEARCHED AMERICAN MARKETS DESIGNED THEIR OWN PRODUCTS SPENT HEAVILY TO DEVELOP BRAND NAMES AND CONTROLLED THEIR OWN MARKETING
01mc02071 THEY VIEW AMERICAN COMPANIES MOSTLY AS COMPETITORS

01mc020g1 THE CHANGING PERCEPTION OF THE TWO IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN IOWA THE TRADITIONAL OPENING ROUND IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT PRESIDENTIAL CHAMPIONSHIP
01mc020h1 IOWA VOTERS CAUCUS TO PICK DELEGATES ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH

01mc020r1 DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
01mc020s1 OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
01mc020t1 EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO

01mc02121 OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
01mc02131 OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
01mc02141 THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
01mc02151 IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
01mc02161 DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
01mc02171 SO SO
01mc02181 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
01mc02191 LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
01mc021a1 WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
01mc021b1 WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL <NOISE> THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
01mc021c1 THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
01mc021d1 CORPORATE BOND PRICES WERE FLAT BOTH ON INVESTMENT GRADE ISSUES AS WELL AS ON JUNK BONDS
