01lc020u0 THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
01lc020v0 SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY

01lc020z0 HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
01lc02100 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
01lc02110 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE BY MESSRS.

01lc02180 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
01lc02190 THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
01lc021a0 BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
01lc021b0 THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
01lc021c0 BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED
01lc021d0 TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN

029c02010 THE COMPANY AND MR. TRUMP ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING IN COURT
029c02020 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MR. TRUMP IS SEEKING TO PREVENT BALLY FROM BUYING GOLDEN NUGGET INCORPORATED'S CASINO HOTEL IN ATLANTIC CITY N. J.
029c02030 THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY BALLY IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
029c02040 ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
029c02050 THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
029c02060 ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
029c02070 BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
029c02080 IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
029c02090 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
029c020a0 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
029c020b0 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
029c020c0 THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
029c020d0 THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
029c020e0 FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
029c020f0 I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
029c020g0 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
029c020h0 GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
029c020i0 THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
029c020j0 SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
029c020k0 I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
029c020l0 SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
029c020m0 HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
029c020n0 THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
029c020o0 IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
029c020p0 THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
029c020q0 DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
029c020r0 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
029c020s0 BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
029c020t0 THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
029c020u0 AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
029c020v0 IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
029c020w0 CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
029c020x0 THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
029c020y0 AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
029c020z0 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
029c02100 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
029c02110 THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
029c02120 BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
029c02130 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
029c02140 BUT EASTERN EXCLUDED A NUMBER OF HIGH TRAFFIC HUB CITIES FROM THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WHICH INVOLVES TRAVEL FROM SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH
029c02150 FOR INSTANCE CHICAGO WHERE UNITED HAS NUMEROUS DEPARTURES AND ATLANTA WHERE DELTA HAS SEVERAL WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROGRAM
029c02160 IN ADDITION TICKETS MUST BE PURCHASED FROM AUGUST FIFTEENTH TO AUGUST TWENTY SIXTH
029c02170 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
029c02180 SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
029c02190 IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
029c021a0 WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
029c021b0 SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARDS READ
029c021c0 THE STUDENTS FLASH A COLORFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE KOREAN FLAG
029c021d0 AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE GREAT LEADER KIM I. L. SUNG
029c021e0 CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
029c021f0 WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS

40ec02040 EURO PESSIMISM IS GIVING WAY TO EURO OPTIMISM AMONG EXECUTIVES RECENT POLLS SUGGEST
40ec02050 BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS AND EURO POLITICIANS CONTINUE TO CLAMOR FOR EUROPEAN SOLUTIONS
40ec02060 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER EUROPEAN SOLUTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR WHATEVER STILL AILS EUROPE
40ec02070 MUCH OF THE OPTIMISM FUELING WESTERN FINANCIAL FLOWS TO THE SOVIETS IS A REACTION TO MR. GORBACHEV'S GLASNOST

40ec020w0 LORENZO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT HAS CLEARLY IMPACTED OUR TRAFFIC LEVELS AT BOTH COMPANIES PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST WHERE OUR OPPONENTS HAVE GENERATED A LOUDER NOISE LEVEL
40ec020x0 WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY

40ec02170 HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
40ec02180 MOST ECONOMISTS IN THE U. S. SEE THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT ALSO SHRINKING
40ec02190 THAT SHOULD HELP JAPAN
40ec021a0 BUT JAPANESE FEAR THAT EMOTIONS AIRED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WILL BE BAD NEWS FOR THEM WHOEVER WINS
40ec021b0 LISTENING TO DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS JUST LIKE SEEING THE GHOST OF U. S.
40ec021c0 REPRESENTATIVE RICHARD GEPHARDT SAYS A RECENT EDITORIAL IN THE SANKEI SHIMBUN A POPULAR JAPANESE NEWSPAPER REFERRING TO THE CANDIDATE WHO SUPPORTED PROTECTIONISM IN THE PRIMARIES
